Scenario 1 

Scenario 1 — Billing transfer (BEST case, no downtime)
CSP → EA within the SAME Microsoft Entra tenant
If the CSP subscription and EA enrollment are in the same tenant, Microsoft supports a subscription transfer:
✅ What happens

The subscription stays the same
Resources do not move
No downtime
Only billing ownership and agreement type change

✅ How it’s done

Use Azure subscription / product transfer (Microsoft Cost Management)
Coordinated between customer, CSP partner, and Microsoft

✅ Microsoft‑supported
Microsoft explicitly documents subscription transfers between CSP and EA as a billing ownership transfer, not a resource migration [learn.microsoft.com], [docs.azure.cn]
⚠️ Limitations

Billing & usage history does not move
Quotas may reset to EA defaults
Tenant must be the same

✅ This is the preferred approach whenever possible
